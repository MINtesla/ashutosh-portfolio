# Ashutosh — Portfolio (GitHub Pages)

This repository will host a simple, responsive portfolio website ready for GitHub Pages.

What I added:
- `index.html` — main website
- `assets/style.css` — styles
- `assets/script.js` — small client-side scripts
- `.nojekyll` — ensures GitHub Pages won't filter files via Jekyll
- `README.md` — this file

Quick steps to publish (GitHub Pages):
1. Commit is made to branch `main` (root).
2. Go to the repository Settings → Pages.
3. Under "Build and deployment" choose "Branch: main" and folder "/" (root), then Save.
4. After a minute your site will be available at `https://MINtesla.github.io/ashutosh-portfolio/`.

Customization:
- Replace the sample text, project cards and links in `index.html`.
- Update `assets/style.css` to change colors/typography.
- Replace the `mailto:you@example.com` with your real email in the contact form and `assets/script.js`.
- The resume link points to `/ashu_resume.pdf` (already present in the repo). Keep that filename or update the link.

Notes:
- `.nojekyll` is included to prevent Jekyll from ignoring files or directories that start with an underscore.
- If you want a custom domain, add a `CNAME` file with your domain and configure DNS.

If you'd like, I can:
- Commit these files to `main` now.
- Add additional content (projects, images, social links).
- Switch to a different layout or framework (e.g., simple React/Vite app).
